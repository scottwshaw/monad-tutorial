;; Here's the correct end result done without the monand form.  It just
;; applies concat to the outer function call.  It basically just calls
;; (apply concat ...) on the list provided by the first try 
(apply concat (map (fn [a] (map (fn [b] (* a b)) (range a))) (range 5)))

;; The functional form of the correct flat answer try
;; Note that concat has to be applied to both function bindings to simulate
;; the mbind form.  If you only had the outer concat without the list call
;; it would work just fine, but because you have to apply the mbind at each stage
;; of the computation, you have to undo the inner concat by turning the results
;; into Lists instead of Integers
(apply concat (map (fn [a] 
		     (apply concat (map (fn [b] (list (* a b)))
			  (range a))))
		   (range 5)))

;; presumably, this is the same as
(defn m-bind-second-try [sequence function]
  (apply concat (map function sequence)))

;; The manual form using the m-bind function
(m-bind-second-try (range 5)  
		   (fn [a]
		     (m-bind-second-try (range a)  
					(fn [b] (list (* a b))))))

   m-bind m-bind-second-try])
